Lane Digital Scorecard
======================

This project is a result of rapid prototype of a digital scorecard for use at [Lane Community College](http://www.lanecc.edu) during 2012. A running example may be viewed at [http://apps.lanecc.edu/scorecard](http://apps.lanecc.edu/scorecard)

You may find it helpful to know that we used Python 2.7 and Django 1.4.5 on a mySQL backend, with Django in a virtualenv. Unfortunately, a number of variables in the templates for this project are static, and will need to be edited in order to run on your machine. If clicking on links gives you a 404 error, first try removing '/scorecard' from the URL. 

The administrative interface can be accessed via /admin/

Unfortunately, because this scorecard was open sourced more than a year after being originally developed, some discrepancies may have developed between the running example above and the code provided here. Bug reports are welcome.
